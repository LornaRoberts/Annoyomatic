# Annoyomatic
Never ending random annoying phrases page. 

Started life as an exercise from Colt Steele's 'JavaScript Bootcamp' Udemy course. His version just printed to the console.
I took this and created a web version which prints the annoying phrase to the screen in a never ending parade.

I found finding the right syntax for getting the function to print to the div challenging but I did succeed in the end.
